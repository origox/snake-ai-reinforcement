    - Setting up board, create snake, create fruit
    - Impl. game rules
2. Agent
3. Model



# Reinforcement Learning(RL)

## High level view
Like teaching your pet a new trick. When pet performs the trick it gets a reward otherwise none.

## From Wikipedia
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.[1] Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

## RL training

The goal is to train an agent. The agent receives observations and a reward from the environement and sends actions to the environment.

The agent contains two components: a policy and a learning algorithm.

- The policy is a mapping that selects actions based on observations from the environement
- The learning algorithm cont. updates the policy parameters based on actions, observations and rewards.

## RL Workflow
1. Formulate problem
2. Create environment
3. Define reward
4. Create agent
5. Train agent
6. Validate agent
7. Deploy policy
